			<p>S-Trip (Student Trip) is a Canadian youth travel company which provides young people with options for

				and were found to be high users of the site.
			</p>
			<p>My role was to work closely with the client to develop a sitemap and wireframes. I then compiled research
				on appropriate tone of voice for the audience before creating the design concepts.
