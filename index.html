			</header>
			<p>The Trade website for Air New Zealand was given a full redesign. My role was to merge the information
				from user groups and wireframes from the IA, taking a user-centred approach to organising and displaying
				the content. Focus groups found users wanted a site that: Is easy to find content, content is up to
				date, has a search function, has ability to share content, simple.
			</p>
			<p>The solution is clear, spacious and simple, with the focus on the content. Content is tagged, making it
				easy to find through search filters and contextual links. The “briefcase” allows users to collate
				information from the site and send as an email.
